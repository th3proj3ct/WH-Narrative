      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Blast (X) Special Rule use a Blast Marker to determine how many Hits are caused.&quot;
When making attacks with a Weapon that has the Blast (X) Special Rule, before any Hit Tests are made, a Blast Marker must first be placed to determine how many Hits may be inflicted by the attack. The Player making the attack must place the Blast Marker indicated in brackets as part of the Special Rule so that the hole in the middle is entirely over the base of any one model in the Target Unit. Once the blast Marker has been placed, the Player making the attack must make a Hit Test for the attack, and each Model from the Target Unit that is fully or partially under the Blast Marker will suffer 1 Hit if the Hit Test is successful.

*Hits on Other Units*
If any Models form Units other than the Target Unit are fully or partially covered by the Blast Marker, then a new Fire Group must be created for those Hits and set to one side. Continue resolving the Shooting Attack on the original Target Unit, and once that Shooting Attack has been completely resolved begin a new Shooting Attack to resolve those additional Fire Groups generated for Units other than the original Target Unit.

If the Hit Test is unsuccessful then no Hits are inflicted and the Player making the attack must make a Scatter Roll for the Blast Marker (see the Rules for Scatter in the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness Rulebook). Once a Scatter Roll has been made for the Blast Marker and it has been moved, one Hit is inflicted on a Unit for each Model from that Unit that is wholly or partially covered by the Blast Marker.</description>

      <description>&quot;Weapons with this Special Rule may inflict Hits on the Models making Shooting Attacks with them.&quot;
When the Controlling Player declares that attacks will be made for a Model using a Weapon or Profile that has the Overload (X) Special Rule, any Hit rolls made for those attacks that result in a number that is equal to or less than the value of X attached to the variant of the Overload Special Rule that the Weapon had, before any modifiers are applied to the roll, are Misfires.

For Weapons that do not make Hit Tests, such as Weapons with the Template Special Rule, instead roll a number of Dice equal to the Firepower Characteristic of the Weapon used to make the attack after the attack has been declared and the number of Models hit is determined. Each Dice that results in a number equal to or less than the value of X attached to the variant of the Overload Special Rule that the Weapon had creates a Misfire. This does not affect the number of Hits on the Target Unit created by this attack.

For each Misfire, the Unit for which the Hit Tests were made suffer a Hit - these Hits must form a new &apos;Misfire Group&apos;.

Once the current Shooting Attack and any Reactions triggered by it have been fully resolved, the Misfire Group must be resolved. A Misfire Group is resolved in the same way as any other Fire Group or Strike Group, using the Profile of the Weapon used for the Fire Group or Strike Group it was created from. Wounds, Glancing Hits, or Penetrating Hits from this Misfire Group are allocated by the Controlling Player, and must be allocated to a Model that made attacks as part of the Fire Group or Strike Group that generated the Misfire Group. If a Hit from a Misfire Group is generated by an attack made by a Model with the Vehicle Type, then it is resolved against the lowest Armour Value from all of the Model&apos;s facings.

Hits, Wounds, or Casualties inflicted upon a Unit as a result of this Special Rule do not cause Leadership or Cool Checks, and Hits inflicted as part of a Misfire Group do not trigger any Special Rules that take effect as a result of a certain value on a Hit Test.</description>

A Critical Hit automatically inflicts a wound without any dice being rolled, counting as the roll of a &apos;6&apos; for any variable Special Rules that might be triggered by a Wound Test, and increases the Damage of the Hit by +1.</description>

      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Armour-breaker (x) Special Rule can sometimes inflict an extra point of Damage.&quot;
When any Armour Penetration Test is made for an Attack or Model with Armour-breaker (X) Special Rule, and it results in a Penetrating Hit - roll a Dice. If the result of that Dice roll is equal to or greater than the value of X attached to this variant of the Armour-breaker (X) Special Rule, then the Damage Characteristic of that Penetrating Hit is increased by 1. Note that the armour-breaker (X) Special Rule may only be triggered by an Armour Penetration Test and has no effect when making a Wound Test.</description>

      <description>&quot;A Weapon with the Armourbane Special Rule counts Glancing Hits as Penetrating Hits.&quot;
When making Armour Penetration tests for an attack with this Special Rule, a result that is equal to, or greater than, the target Armour Value inflicts a Penetrating Hit. A Weapon with this Special Rule can never inflict a Glancing Hit, and any Rule that would force them to do so instead inflicts a Penetrating Hit.</description>

    <rule name="Rending (X)" id="d2ed-7778-39d9-22f1" hidden="false">
      <description>&quot;With a Weapon that has the Rending (X) Special Rule, there is a chance that a Hit Test may result in an automatic wound.&quot;
When any Hit Test is made for an attack with the Rending (X) Special Rule, if the result of the Dice roll, before any modifiers are applied, is equal to or greater than the value of X attached to this variant of the Rending (X) Special Rule, then if a Hit is inflicted by that Hit Test, that Hit becomes a &apos;Rending Hit&apos;.

When required to make a Wound Test for a Rending Hit, no Dice are rolled and the Wound Test succeeds automatically regardless of the Weapon&apos;s Strength or the Target&apos;s Toughness Characteristic. The Wound Test is treated as if the result had been &apos;6&apos; for the purposes of any Rules that would be triggered on certain results of a Wound Test. Wounds caused by a Rending Hit use the AP and Damage Characteristic of the Weapon used to make the attack and retain any Special Rules that Weapon had.

If the Target Unit for an attack made with a Weapon that has this Special Rule includes any Models with the Vehicle Type, then this Special Rule has no effect.</description>

    <rule name="Template" id="be84-7b4d-1fdb-baa7" hidden="false">
      <description>&quot;Weapons and attacks with the Template Special Rule use the Flame Template to determine how many Models they Hit.&quot;
When making attacks for a Weapon or other effect that has the Template Special Rule, or otherwise uses a Template , no Hit Tests are made for the attack. Instead, when directed to make Hit Tests for such an attack, a single Template is placed to determine how many Hits are generated. A Template must be placed so that its narrow end is touching the Base of the Model, the edge of a Model&apos;s Hull (if it has the Vehicle Type) or other point being used to make the attack, and so that no part of the Template covers or touches a friendly Model&apos;s Base, Hull or otherwise would inflict Hits on a friendly Model. Within these restrictions, the Player making the attack may place the Template in an orientation of their choosing as long as at least one Model from the original Target Unit remains under the Template. If the Template cannot be placed under these restrictions, such as if it cannot be placed without covering or touching friendly Models, then no attack may be made.

Once the Template has been placed, a number of Hits using the Profile of the Weapon or effect are inflicted on the Target Unit equal to the number of Models touched or covered by the Template. If the Weapon or attack has a Firepower Characteristic greater than 1 then only a single Model touched or covered by the Template is equal to the Firepower Characteristic of the attack or Weapon. If more than one enemy Unit has Models that are touched or covered by the Template in its final position, then Hits are inflicted on all such Units as noted above, Hits on Units other than the original target form a new Fire Group that must be placed to one side and used to resolve a separate Shooting Attack on the additional Target Unit once all attacks and Fire Groups from the original Shooting Attack have been fully resolved. When resolving Armour Penetration Tests for Hits inflicted by a Weapon with this Special Rule, the position of the Model that was used to make the attack is used to determine which Armour Facing is used.

Note that the Rules require template to be placed in Base Contact with the Model being used to make the attack, but his Model is not counted as having been Hit by the attack and does not stop the attack from being made. However, this only applies to the individual Model being used to make the attack, not to other Models in the same Unit.

Weapons with this Special Rule will have their Range Characteristic as &apos;Template&apos;. This does not count as a value of &apos;0&apos; or &apos;-&apos;. If a Rule requires a number for the Range Characteristic (other than for making attacks, which must be conducted using the Rules noted above) then all Weapons and attacks with this Special Rule are considered to have a Range Characteristic of &apos;8&apos;.

*Other Templates*
In some rare cases a Weapon may use a different Template than the standard Flame Template, in these cases the Template Rule maybe expressed with a bracketed section stating which Template must be used when attack with that Weapon. Otherwise, the Rules for its use are unchanged from those noted under the Template Special Rule.

An example of this is the use of the Hellstorm Template for certain very large Weapons. In this case the Rule would be expressed as &apos;Template (Hellstorm)&apos; and the attack would be resolved using the Template Special Rule, but placing the larger Hellstorm Template.</description>

      <description>&quot;Weapons and other attacks that have the Panic (X) Special Rule have a chance of inflicting the Routed Status on the Target Unit.&quot;
If a Shooting Attack made for a Weapon or Model with this Special Rule inflicts one or more wounds on a Target Unit, regardless of whether any Damage is inflicted, that Target Unit must make a Leadership Check in the Morale Sub-Phase of the same Player Turn. If this Check is failed then all Models in the Unit gain the Routed Status, if the Check is passed then there is no further effect. The value of X attached to this Special Rule is applied as a negative modifier to the Leadership Characteristics of Models in the Target Unit when making Checks caused by an attack with this Special Rule. If the attack includes multiple Weapons with different variations of this Special Rule the modifiers do not stack - use only the greatest modifier.</description>

Note that if that Profile also has the Limited (X) Special Rule, this does not allow it to be selected to make attacks more than the number of times equal to the value of that Special Rule.</description>

If the Active Player makes a Repair Test in the Statuses Sub-Phase of the End Phase for a Model with the Vehicle Type with this Special Rule, they ignore the usual Target Number of 6. Instead, the value of X attached to the variant of this Special Rule is used as the Target Number for that Repair Test. For example, a Model with the Auto-repair (4+) Special Rule would pass any Repair Tests made for it on the result of a 4 or higher.</description>

If a Melee Attack made for a Weapon or Model with this Special Rule inflicts one or more wounds on a Target Unit, regardless of whether any Damage is inflicted, until the end of the Phase, that Unit is considered to be &apos;aflame&apos;. If the Controlling Player of a Unit that is aflame is required to make a Leadership Check during that Phase for a Combat that includes that Unit, the value of X on this Special Rule is applied as an additional negative modifier to the Leadership Characteristic being used for that Check.</description>

      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Precision (X) Special Rule are allocated by the Attacking Player, not the Defender.&quot;
When any Hit Test is made for an attack with the Precision (X) Special Rule, if the result of the Dice roll, before any modifiers are applied, is equal to or great than the value of X attached to this variant of the Precision (X) Special Rule, then if a Hit is inflicted by that roll, that Hit becomes a &apos;Precision Hit&apos;.


These Precision Hits must form a separate Fire Group or Strike Group. Wound Tests are made as normal for Precision Hits and cause Precision wounds. In Step 8 of the Shooting Attack process or Step 7 of the Initiative Step sequence, when selecting a Target Model for a Fire Group or Strike Group that is made up of Precision wounds, the Target Model is not selected using the normal Rules. Instead the attacking Player chooses which Model in the Target Unit will be the Target Model, and may select any Model that is a part of that Unit.


Note that Models Engaged in a Challenge cannot use this Special Rule to allocate Hits to any Model other than the enemy Model that is Engaged in the same Challenge and that any attacks which are made as Snap Shots, or for Weapons or attacks that have either the Blast (X) , Barrage (X), Template or Reaping Blow (X) Special Rules, may never trigger the Precision (X) Special Rule no matter what the result of the Hit Test is.</description>

A Hit Test made for a Weapon with the Skyfire Special Rule ignores any Rule that would require attacks made targeting an enemy Unit that contains any Models with the Flyer Sub-Type to be made as Snap Shots. Instead such an attack makes a normal Hit Test using the Ballistic Skill Characteristic of the attacking Model - this includes attacks made as part of any Reaction.

      <description>&quot;A Weapon with this Special Rule may be used to attack Target Units out of Line of Sight.&quot;
If a Unit for which a Shooting attack is made includes any Models with one or more Weapons with this Special Rule, then in Step 2 of the Shooting Attack process they may ignore the restriction on requiring Line of Sight to a Target Unit. If a Player uses this Special Rule to declare a Shooting Attack on a Unit that the attacking Unit cannot draw a Line of Sight to, then in Step 3 of the Shooting Attack process that Player may only declare attacks with Weapons that have this Special Rule.


If a Weapon with this Special Rule and the Blast (X) Special Rule is used to attack a Unit without a Line of Sight to that Unit, then no Hit Test is made and an Indirect Scatter Roll must be made for the Blast Marker placed as part of the attack. If such a Weapon makes more than a single attack then a separate Indirect Scatter Roll is made for each attack. When making an Indirect Scatter Roll for such an attack, the number of Dice rolled alongside the Scatter Dice is determined by the value of X for the Weapon with the Barrage (X) Special Rule, the value of these Dice is then totalled to find the distance the attack Scatters.</description>

Note that the Medic (X) Special Rule does not allow Medic Tests to be made, but simply establishes the Target Number for such Tests - Recovery Tests may only be made if another Special Rule, Reaction or Gambit allows them (see, for example, the Medic! Advanced Reaction).


*Medic Tests*
A Medic Test is made when one or more Unsaved Wounds are allocated to a Model, and is resolved by rolling a Dice and comparing the results to the value of &apos;X&apos; in the variant of the Medic (X) Special Rule present in a Unit, then the Controlling Player chooses which is used to determine the Target Number. If the Medic Test is successful then a single Unsaved Wound allocated to the Model has its Damage reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If a Medic Test is failed, then any Unsaved Wounds allocated to the Model are resolved as normal.&quot;</description>

- If a Unit that includes a majority of Models with the Vanguard (X) Special Rule has at least one attack made for it in a Combat that results in one or more enemy Units that had at least one Model within 3&quot;&quot; of an Objective at the start of that Assault Phase either Falling Back from Combat or being Massacred.


Note that the Vanguard (X) Special Rule may only be used to score Victory Points once per Objective per Player Turn - no matter how many enemy Units were Controlling or Locked in Combat near that Objective.</description>
